Dec 26 2021

Todo:

- optimize requirements
- design
- Create react app skeleton
	- reactJS frontend
	- django/react backend
		- probably react
		- determine what needs to be saved in backend


Actions:

-Update cmder and vscode preferences -> create nice dev space

- talk to james about current progress and notes
- Draft list of initial requirements
- Review list with james/Alison/Mel

-Chat with Cooper on best path forward
	- easiest backend dev strategy
	- react changes since 2 years ago
	- wether rented servers are needed

	-prolly do react backend and frontend using mongoose - like IBM-C
	-host on AWS or horoku
		-follow AWS documentation for quick setup

	- amazon email API, mailchimp
	-try typescript instead of javascript? -learning curve but maybe worth it
	-elastic beanstalk - umbrella for connecting components and deployment

	-coop reqs
		-react frontend, express backend, mongoose API for front-back comms
		-deployment: netlify - like horoku but free (probably)
		-start dev without a database and see if data can just be stored local 
		-start with just frontend?

- Find react/python library for creating excel sheets from data
